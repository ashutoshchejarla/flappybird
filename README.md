This is a clone of the original game 'Flappy Bird' made in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)
##How is it made???
1) I first created the game in Scratch
2) Then i went to a website which HTMLIFIES the scratch project called [TurboWarp Packager](https://packager.turbowarp.org/)
3) i downloaded the zip file.
4) then uploaded onto github enabling me to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
5) and that's how i make games (currently as of 2025 april)
